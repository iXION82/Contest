## 📂 Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- **`frontend`**: Contains the React frontend application.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB (Local or Atlas connection string)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Backend-Starter-main
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `Backend-Starter-main` directory. You can calculate the following values:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/job-matching-db
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend application should now be running (usually at `http://localhost:5173`) and communicating with your backend server.
